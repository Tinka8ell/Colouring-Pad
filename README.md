# Colouring-Pad
A simple colouring to allow colouring in of simple outlines scanned in.

The app uses tkinter and PILL to modify images.
It was intended to move this to an Android tablet, 
but that proved more difficult as that environment is too controlling 
and even the best (free) python implementations struggle with basic python updates.

Still gave hours of fun during the first covid lockdown.
